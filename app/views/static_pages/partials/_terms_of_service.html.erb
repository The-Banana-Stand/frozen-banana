  <strong>4. ATTENTION ON MEETINGSLICE</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4.1. Overview.</strong>
  MeetingSlice allows users who want to meet (“<strong>Sales People</strong>
  ”) to purchase the attention in the form of a meeting of users who want to
  hear the best product and service ideas for their business (“    <strong>Decision Makers</strong>”). By purchasing attention through a
  Meeting Fee, Sales Persons can express the value they perceive in receiving
  a Decision Makers attention. In turn, Sales People pay the Company a
  Platform Fee for the transaction processing of the meeting.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4.2.</strong>
  <strong>Giving Attention.</strong>
  If you give attention and take a meeting with a Salesperson, your
  organization will be entitled to receive the list price (“Compensation”)
  for your time as seen in the Meeting Marketplace search tab. For
  MeetingSlice to deliver the <strong>Compensation</strong> you must verify
  your email address and mobile phone number with MeetingSlice and link a
  valid and verifiable external payment account via MeetingSlice (“    <strong>External Account</strong>”) to your organization that enables us to
  disburse such Compensation. You will lose your eligibility to receive
  Compensation if you do not link an External Account to your MeetingSlice
  account within 30 days of the date upon which you first receive notice via
  MeetingSlice that you have a meeting booked on MeetingSlice’s platform.
  Further, you or your ogranizaion must keep such account information
  up-to-date at all times to continue to receive compensation. We reserve the
  right to change the Compensation structure from time to time in our sole
  discretion. MeetingSlice will indicate the Compensation you are eligible to
  receive via your MeetingSlice account. We may set minimum disbursement
  thresholds, whereby you can only instruct us to disburse Compensation to an
  External Account if you have met certain minimum accrual thresholds. We may
  modify the minimum disbursement thresholds from time to time in our sole
  discretion. The current minimum threshold amount is $100.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4.3. Getting Attention.</strong>
  When requesting a meeting with a Decision Maker, you must accurately
  identify the purpose of the meeting and may not falsely misrepresent the
  product or service to be discussed in the meeting. Under no circumstances
  is the Decision Maker obliged to purchase the product or service discussed
  in the meeting.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4.4. Cancelation/Refund.</strong>
  The cancelation policy for Meeting Slice shall be as follows:
</p>
<p>
  a. If the Salesperson has created an initial booking request and the
  intended Decision Maker declines the meeting or does not respond with date
  and time availability within 7 days of a Sales Person’s initial request for
  booking, MeetingSlice will not charge the Sales Person any expense.
</p>
<p>
  b. If the Decision Maker indicates they do not have Decision Making
  Authority over the subject matter described by the Sales Person and the
  Sales Person wishes to cancel the meeting, they will not be charged.
</p>
<p>
  c. If the Decision Maker responds to the initial booking request with their
  availability and the Sales Person makes no effort to select a date and time
  when the Decision Maker is available or request to schedule on another
  date, the Sales Person will be charged the Platform Fee.
</p>
<p>
  d. If both Decision Maker and Salesperson have agreed on upon a meeting
  date and time and:
</p>
<p>
  (1) the Decision Maker cancels the meeting, then the Salesperson will be
  given a full refund
</p>
<p>
  (2) the Salesperson cancels the meeting, then the Salesperson will only be
  charged the Platform Fee.
</p>
<p>
  e. If the Sales Person asks for a refund of the Compensation and/or
  Platform Fee after the meeting is over, MeetingSlice in its sole discretion
  shall determine the fair amount of refund if any.
</p>
<p>
  f. Company makes no guarantees to the quality of attention the Sales Person
  will receive or the amount of time the Sales Person will receive from the
  Decision Maker. Under no circumstances shall Company be financial obligated
  to grant a refund to the Sales Person for lack of quality attention or
  unpredictable meeting length. Company will make its best effort to create
  the right incentive structure for the Decision Maker to provide high
  quality attention in a predictable meeting length.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4.5. Reviews.</strong>
  Company may provide you with the ability to submit reviews and ratings of
  other users (“<strong>Reviews</strong>”) in connection with the with other
  users. You may only submit a Review about a user based upon first-hand
  experiences you have had with that user via a meeting arranged or purchased

<p>
  <strong>15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong>
    Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
    arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Company and limits the
    manner in which you can seek relief from us.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  (a) Except for small claims disputes in which you or Company seek to bring
  an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your
  billing address or disputes in which you or Company seeks injunctive or
  other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual
  property, you and Company waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any
  dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or use of MeetingSlice (“    <strong>Disputes</strong>”) resolved in court. Instead, all Disputes will
  be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Omaha,
  Nebraska in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
  Procedures ("<strong>Rules</strong>") of the Judicial Arbitration and
  Mediation Services ("<strong>JAMS</strong>"), which are available on the    <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS website</a> and hereby incorporated
  by reference. You either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and
  understand the rules of JAMS or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the
  rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not
  apply for any reason.
</p>
<p>
  (b)
  <strong>
    You and Company agree that any Dispute is personal to you and Company
    and that any Dispute will be resolved solely through individual
    arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class
    action or any other type of representative proceeding.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  (c) You and Company agree that the enforceability of this Section will be
  substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
  U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "<strong>FAA</strong>"), to the maximum extent
  permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the
  JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all
  procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any
  remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that
  the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration
  or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The
  arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not
  consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of
  class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving
  more than one individual. You and Company agree that for any arbitration
  you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Company will pay the
  remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Company,
  Company will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Company agree that the
  state or federal courts of the State of Nebraska and the United States
  sitting in Douglas County, Nebraska USA have exclusive jurisdiction over
  any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
</p>
<p>
  (d) Any claim based upon a Dispute must be filed within one year after such
  Dispute arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that
  you and Company will not have the right to assert a claim based upon the
  Dispute.
</p>
<p>
  (e) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30)
  days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 15 by
  contacting us by email at privacy-tos@MeetingSlice.com. In order to be
  effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and clearly
  indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of
  binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance
  with Section 16.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>16. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong>
    These Terms and your access to and use of MeetingSlice will be governed
    by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of State of
    Nebraska, USA, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles
    (whether of Nebraska or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
    application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between
    the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in
    small claims court will be resolved by the state or federal courts of
    the State of Nebraska and the United States sitting in Douglas County,
    Nebraska USA.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>17. AMENDMENTS</strong>
  <br/>
  We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time in our sole
  discretion. If we change these Terms, we will provide notice of such

  following our provision of such notice will confirm your acceptance of the
  revised Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop
  using MeetingSlice.
</p>

  <br/>
  We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to suspend
  or terminate your right to access or use MeetingSlice. You may discontinue
  using MeetingSlice at any time.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>19. SEVERABILITY</strong>
  <br/>
  If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or
  unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable
  from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any
  remaining provisions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>20. MISCELLANEOUS</strong>
  <br/>
  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Company
  relating to your access to and use of MeetingSlice. The failure of Company
  to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
  operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these
  Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
  Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for
  the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party
  beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
